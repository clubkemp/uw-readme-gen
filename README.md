  ## Description 
  Working on projects is cool, sharing the with the world is even cooler. Know what isnâ€™t cool? Bad READMEs. I know, they are a drag to write, but proper documentation can mean the difference between someone being able to run and use your code or them throwing it in the trash. That is why we have created the README generator. This CLI takes in a few user prompts, and outputs into the same directory a README with all the most nessesary sections for typical projects. Edge cases exist, so make sure to interject more MD and clean up your document after generation. Enjoy!
